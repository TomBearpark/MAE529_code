Please see write up in `/writing/` for details of the project. 

Description of file structure:

- `/Code` contains all code used in the project so far. 
- `/input_data` contains the ERCOT data provided by Professor Jenkins. This is just copied from [his Github](https://github.com/east-winds/power-systems-optimization/tree/master/Project/ercot_brownfield_expansion). I copied into this folder to ensure this project stays replicable, in case the inputs change / moves. 
- `/outputs` contains plots and summary tables of results, from post processing of model run outputs, and of data inputs. This is currently mainly empty, since I haven't yet begun properly analysing results. 
- `/results` contains model run outputs. 
- `/writing` contains pdf and word files with write up of results that I am handing in for this project. It also contains the project prompts provided by Prof Jenkins for reference.
